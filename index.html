        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>The goal of the game is to find all pairs of cards as quickly as possible. The player that finds the greatest number of pairs wins.</p>
        <p>To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card in the card pile.
          It will flip over and reveal a picture of a travel destination.
          Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will have completed a match!
          If they don't, you'll have three seconds to look at them before they flip back over.
          Then it's time for the other player to try!
        </p>
        <p>After you play, you'll see the name of the final winner and how long it took to win the game.</p>
